Passage 1: "Background and Purpose- According to our prior studies, left atrial (LA) distensibility was associated significantly with left ventricular filling pressure in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), chronic stable angina, and severe mitral regurgitation. LA distensibility can be used as noninvasive Swan-Ganz catheter. Additionally, it could predict in-hospital mortality in AMI patients. In the current study, left atrial distensibility guiding management in advanced chronic heart failure will be performed to assess whether those management could influence long-term prognosis including mortality rate, rehospitalization rate and the duration of rehospitalization."
