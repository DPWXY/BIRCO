[1] > [2] > [3] > [0]

The most relevant passage is [1], as it directly addresses the search query by discussing the need to minimize the risk of autonomous vehicles to the public, especially pedestrians, and proposing a model that can inform the vehicles to avoid crowded streets. Passage [2] is also relevant as it discusses the use of computer vision models for pedestrian detection, but it does not directly address the specific context of autonomous vehicles. Passage [3] is less relevant as it focuses on the generalization of pedestrian motion, rather than the specific task of detecting pedestrians in real-time for autonomous vehicles. Finally, passage [0] is the least relevant as it does not address the specific task of pedestrian detection

The most relevant passage is [1], as it directly addresses the concept of conformal prediction and its application in scenarios with limited data availability. Passage [3] is also highly relevant, as it discusses a related concept (set-valued prediction) and provides insights into the benefits of using such approaches. Passage [2] is less relevant, as it focuses on a different aspect of natural language processing (NLP) (i.e., document representation learning). Finally, passage [0] is the least relevant, as it does not directly address conformal prediction or its application in limited data scenarios.

  Sure, here's the ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the search query:

[3] > [2] > [1] > [0]

The most relevant passage is [3], as it directly addresses the task of enhancing the expressive power of GNNs to differentiate between graphs with the same local neighborhood structure, and proposes a solution using structure-related features. Passage [2] is also highly relevant, as it discusses the problem of over-smoothing in GNNs and proposes a solution using node-level capsules. Passage [1] is less relevant, as it only discusses the traditional task of link prediction and does not address the specific task of enhancing GNN expressive power. Passage [0] is the least relevant, as it does not address the search query at all.

The most relevant passage is [1], as it directly addresses the search query by discussing conformal prediction and its application in scenarios with limited data availability. Passage [3] is also highly relevant, as it discusses the use of importance weights to quantify uncertainty in predictions, which is a key aspect of conformal prediction. Passage [2] is less relevant, as it focuses on a different aspect of machine learning (i.e., uncertainty quantification) without directly addressing conformal prediction. Finally, passage [0] is the least relevant, as it does not mention conformal prediction at all.

[1] > [2] > [3] > [4]

The most relevant passage is [1], as it directly addresses the search query by discussing the use of gradient descent to train a model to solve a zero-sum game, and the potential pitfalls of gradient descent. Passage [2] is also relevant, as it discusses the use of gradient descent to train a model to play a game, but does not specifically address the zero-sum game context. Passage [3] is less relevant, as it discusses a specific application of gradient descent in the context of a game, but does not address the general principles of gradient descent for zero-sum games. Passage [4] is the least relevant, as it does not directly address the search query.

The most relevant passage is [1], as it directly addresses the issue of avoiding a delta function optimal prediction distribution using a different loss function, and mentions rejection sampling as a possible approach. The second most relevant passage is [3], which also discusses the issue of mode collapses and how to avoid them, and mentions the use of generative models that can sample their output. The least relevant passage is [4], which does not directly address the specific issue of avoiding a delta function optimal prediction distribution, but rather mentions the use of generative models for image datasets.

The most relevant passage is [1], as it directly addresses the search query by discussing conformal prediction and its application in scenarios with limited data availability. Passage [3] is also highly relevant, as it discusses the use of conformal prediction in regression settings and its advantages over traditional best-one prediction. Passage [2] is less relevant, as it focuses on a different aspect of machine learning (explaining the predictions of AI models) and does not directly address conformal prediction. Finally, passage [0] is the least relevant, as it does not mention conformal prediction at all.

  Sure, here's the ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the search query:

[1] > [3] > [2] > [0]

The most relevant passage is [1], as it directly addresses the search query by discussing conformal prediction and its application in scenarios with limited data availability. Passage [3] is also highly relevant, as it discusses the use of transformers and CNNs for task analysis and transfer learning. Passage [2] is less relevant, as it focuses on a specific application of conformal prediction in medical diagnosis, while the search query is more general. Finally, passage [0] is the least relevant, as it does not directly address the search query or the concepts of conformal prediction or limited data availability.

The most relevant passage is [1], as it directly addresses the use of human feedback as sparse reward signals in reinforcement learning, and the challenges of obtaining large amounts of human feedback data. [3] is also highly relevant, as it discusses the use of human feedback to train a machine-learned model for generalization, and the hybrid approach that combines explicit user feedback and inferred user satisfaction predictions. [2] is less relevant, as it focuses on the use of reward shaping in reinforcement learning, but does not specifically address the use of human feedback as a reward signal. [0] is the least relevant, as it discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques for training agents to perform tasks, but does not address

  Sure, here's the ranking of the passages based on their relevance to the search query:

[1] > [2] > [3] > [0]

The most relevant passage is [1], as it directly addresses the use of human feedback as sparse reward signals in reinforcement learning, and the challenges of obtaining large amounts of human feedback data. Passage [2] is also relevant, as it discusses the use of human feedback to train reinforcement learning agents, but with a focus on the uncertainty of the feedback. Passage [3] is less relevant, as it focuses on using natural language advice to provide a richer feedback signal to a reinforcement learning agent, rather than addressing the specific challenge of sparse human feedback. Finally, passage [0] is the least relevant, as it discusses the use of human feedback to train reinforcement learning agents in a specific context, but does not address
